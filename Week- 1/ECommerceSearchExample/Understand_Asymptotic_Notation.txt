1. Explain Big O Notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.


Big O Notation (O) is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it's used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. Big O notation doesn't measure the exact execution time in seconds. Instead, it measures how the number of operations an algorithm performs scales with respect to the input size (n).

Examples of Common Big O Notations:
O(1): Constant time 
O(logn): Logarithmic time
O(n): Linear time 
O(nlogn): Log-linear time 
O(n^2): Exponential time (e.g., some recursive algorithms like finding all subsets).

Big O notation helps in:

It provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, regardless of the hardware or programming language.
It also allows developers to predict how an algorithm will perform as the input data scales up. An algorithm with O(n) will scale much better than one with O(n^2) for large inputs.
Also, by understanding the time complexity, developers can make informed decisions about which algorithm is most suitable for a given problem and expected input size. For an e-commerce platform, where data scales rapidly, choosing algorithms with better asymptotic complexity is critical.




2. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.



These scenarios describe the minimum, typical, and maximum number of operations an algorithm might perform for a given input size.

1.Best-Case Scenario (Omega Notation / Omega Notation):

Describes the minimum amount of time an algorithm will take.
For search operations, the best case occurs when the item being searched for is found immediately, usually at the very first position checked.
Example (Linear Search): If the target product is the very first product in the array, the search takes just one comparison. Time complexity: O(1).
Example (Binary Search): If the target product is the middle element on the first comparison, the search takes just one comparison. Time complexity: O(1).

2. Average-Case Scenario (Theta Notation):

Describes the expected amount of time an algorithm will take. It's often the most difficult to calculate as it involves probability distributions of inputs.
For search operations, it represents the typical number of comparisons required across all possible inputs.
Example (Linear Search): On average, you might expect to find the item around the middle of the list. Time complexity: O(n).
Example (Binary Search): The average case is very close to the worst case for binary search, as it typically takes
logn comparisons to narrow down the search space. Time complexity: O(logn).

3. Worst-Case Scenario (O Notation / Big O Notation):

Describes the maximum amount of time an algorithm will take, as it provides an upper bound guarantee.
For search operations, the worst case occurs when the item is found at the last possible position, or not found at all, requiring the maximum number of comparisons.
Example (Linear Search): If the target product is the very last product in the array, or if it's not present at all, the search has to examine every single product. Time complexity: O(n).
